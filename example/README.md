# openvpn_flutter_example

Demonstrates how to use the openvpn_flutter plugin.

## Compile the openvpn_flutter plugin

Running the example app will also compile the plugin.

flutter clean
dart pub cache clean
flutter pub cache clean
Remove-Item -Path "android\.gradle"
flutter pub get
flutter run

## VPN Configuration Setup

**Important:** Before running this app, you need to set up your VPN configuration file.

ðŸ“‹ **See [VPN_CONFIG_README.md](VPN_CONFIG_README.md) for detailed setup instructions.**

The app loads VPN configuration from an external file (`assets/vpn_config.ovpn`) that contains your certificates and private keys. This file is excluded from git for security reasons.
